## Proposing a Change

Before writing any code, it's best to propose any changes with the SpeedCurve team first. You can do this by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/SpeedCurve-Metrics/speedcurve-cli/issues/new) and filling out the template provided.

## Submitting a pull request

Please submit changes through GitHub's pull request system by doing the following:

1. [Fork the repository](https://github.com/SpeedCurve-Metrics/speedcurve-cli).
2. Create a new branch from the `master` branch.
3. Use the development workflow outlined below.
4. Make sure you commit any changes to the `docs/` directory.
5. Push your changes to your fork and open a new pull request.

## Development workflow

After cloning the repository, run `npm install` to fetch its dependencies. There are a few commands you can use during development:

* `npm run test` automatically formats the code and runs tests.
* `npm run build` runs the build process including documentation generation.

We recommend running `npm run test` on a regular basis during development.
